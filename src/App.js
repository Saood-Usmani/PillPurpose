      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        PillPurpose aims to create a comprehensive and user-friendlv website
        that serves as a platform for community members to access necessary
        medicines for free, facilitated by generous donations. Recognizing the
        challenges many individuals face in affording essential medications, the
        website will act as a bridge between those in need and individuals or
        organizations willing to donate medications. Through a well-designed and
        intuitive interface, community members can easily browse through a wide
        range of available medicines and submit their requests based on their
        specific requirements. The website will also incorporate a secure and
        confidential registration system to verify the eligibility of donor
        institutes with only allowing medical institutions to donate. To
        facilitate the donation process, the platform will allow donors to list
        the medications they are willing to contribute and enable easy
        communication with recipients. A dedicated team of volunteers will be
        responsible for maintaining the website and ensuring the accuracy of
        information. Through this project, we aim to foster a sense of community
        support, making essential medications accessible to those who would
        otherwise struggle to afford them, ultimately promoting better health
        outcomes and improving the wellbeing of individuals and families in
        need.
